<p><strong>Flash Browsers</strong></p>

<p>While I used to be able to 'side-load' the legacy Adobe Flash Player (.apk) file, this does not seem to be so easily done with Android 4.4.2 onwards. Below, I have trawled through a number of alternative Browsers to see how I can continue to access educational Flash content</p>

<br>

<p>Tested on Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2, Android 4.4.2 (and also on Samsung Note, Android 4.4.2) and using these two 'flash' websites </p>

(1) Drag and Drop: <a href='http://teacher.scholastic.com/clifford1/flash/phonics/index.htm' target='_blank'>scholastic </a> (the 'Drag and Drop: ' below')</p>
(2) Flash Video: <a href='http://www.mystudymate.ie/italian.html' target='_blank'>mystudymate.ie </a> (the 'Flash Video' below)</p>

(both sites work perfectly on my Yarvik Tablet with Android 4.1.1)</p>
