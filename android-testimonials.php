				<h4>Evaluation of Androids in a Learning Support Classroom:</h4>
				<p>
				St. Paul's SNS, Roll:19618B, Ayrfield, Dublin 13. Phone: 01 8472810
				</p>
				<p>
				We procured five Android tablets for the Learning Support Department which we have been using for the past six weeks with the children 
				in a small group setting. I have found them easy to work with and the purchase and download of applications could not be easier. The 
				sheer range and choice available on the play store is somewhat overwhelming, and I did spend a number of evenings downloading and 
				erasing apps which were either suitable or unsuitable for my groups. Pitching apps to your individual groups is down to trial and error, 
				but with the choice of free downloadable versions you are able to try each app out with groups and if satisfied can purchase the more 
				sophisticated version. 
				</p>
				<p>
				What I like about the tablets is that they are portable and children in groups of five may be placed on task whether it be English or 
				Maths in a swift and fuss free manner. I have also used them to assist children in gathering information for school projects, their 
				neatness and portability allowing instantaneous access to the internet without the bother of having to de camp to the computer room. 
				Having recently begun as a Learning Support teacher I was looking for a resource which complimented the traditional resources of books 
				etc, I have no hesitation in recommending this product which at the end of the day helps me to teach and reinforce pupils learning 
				experience in a positive way.

				Pupils comments:
				<ul>
				<li>'It is better than using copies and writing all the time'</li>
				<li>'Itâ€™s great fun to do maths challenges on the tablet, and it saves on waste paper'</li>
				<li>'The screens are easy to work with and the games make you want to be competitive and work faster'</li>
				<li>'The tablets would be great to use for projects in class'</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				Overall a 10/10 for the tablets from teacher and pupils alike.
